## Notes

Building the app presented a few challenges that I successfully navigated. Initially, I encountered a CORS issue when attempting to open the HTML file in the default browser. To overcome this, I opted to use an HTTP server, ensuring smooth communication between the components of the app.

Another challenge involved the delay in reflecting changes made in VSCode onto the live site. At times, I had to restart VSCode to see the modifications take effect, leading to additional debugging efforts. Despite these challenges, the project was enjoyable and rewarding. I appreciated the opportunity to work on it, and the experience taught me valuable lessons in problem-solving and persistence. The project spanned several days, allowing me to tackle each aspect thoroughly and enhance my understanding of the concepts involved. Overall, it was a positive learning experience.
